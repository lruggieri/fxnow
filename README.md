## fx.now
This is a project aimed to provide the latest Forex data for the most common fiat pairs as a free / low-cost fast
and highly available  service.
<br/>The main goal in building this is to get familiar with the issues and hurdles of designing, implementing and deploying
an open-source cloud-based public service.

### System design
![alt text](system_design.png)

With this design, I am trying to produce a fast and highly available service by also taking into consideration a
limited budget.

### Status
This project is still very much in progress :)
<br/>I am contributing to it during my spare time.
